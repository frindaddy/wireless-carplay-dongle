As of 8/20/2025 this won't work without a MFi chip to enable iAP2 authentication. The iPhone needs to authenticate that the accessory it is connecting to is, in fact, an authenticated Apple accessory before it sends any sort of CarPlay packets.

There might be a way to get around this using BLE iAP2 authentication, but I'm not convinced.
